# jarvide-api
The API for interacting with user files

This API is not meant for public use (as of now). We may expose public endpoints later on. For now, while the endpoints are technically public,
you will need the authorization key to access any endpoints.

# Technologies
As of right now, the only technologies in use are:
  - Node.js
  - Prisma
  - Express.js
  - SQLite (Planning on transitioning to PostgreSQL)

# General Reference <a name="ref"></a>

## Objects <a name="objs"></a>
### `File` Object <a name="file-obj"></a>
A `File` object contains the following properties:
- `fileID: String` - The unique indentifier associated with this file.
- `filename: String` - The name of this file.
- `url: String` - The Discord attachment URL that points to this file.

Example `File` object:
```json
{
  "fileID": "ab0915fa-271b-480b-a606-2ba9d3c2613d",
  "filename": "index.js",
  "url": "https://www.discord.com/attachments/123456789/123456789"
}
```

### `Warn` object <a name="warn-obj"></a>
A `Warn` object contains the following properties:
- `warnID: String`: The unique identifier associated with this warn
- `userID: Int`: The user who was warned
- `modID: Int`: The moderator who issued this warning
- `reason: String`: The reason for this warning

### Errors <a name="errors"></a>
All **4XX** error codes will always return a JSON alongside their error codes.
This is the syntax for one:
```json
{
  "ERROR": "MESSAGE"
}
```
Where `MESSAGE` is a short but descriptive string 
that gives more information on what exactly went wrong.
The response code will also closely reflect the error.

### Authentication <a name="auth"></a>
Since the API is currently in an invite-only private stage, you will need an API key to access **any** endpoint. I have given out the API key to a select few. Following is intructions on how to use it.

When sending **any** request to **any** endpoint, you **will** need the API key in the **header**. This is important because it will not be accepted anywhere else (URL params, POST request body, etc...) Here is an example on how one might successfully send an authenticated request to the server:

```
GET https://server-ip/get_file?fileID=579d92b9-0c2a-4337-a269-f6053cf545a6

HEADERS 
{
  "Api-Key": "YOUR API KEY HERE"
}
```

# GitHub Token Endpoints <a name="github"></a>

## GET `/github` <a name="get-github"></a>
Gets the **encrypted** GitHub token associated with a user. 

Note that the user's GitHub token is returned
encrypted an no server-side decryption was done. This is to ensure man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks cannot gain any valuable information. If someone were to do a MITM attack and gain access to the transmitted 
information, it would be encrypted, and hence, useless without the proper key to decrypt it. 

What you use to encrypt and decrypt is up to you. You can even store it in plaintext if you wish,
though this is highly discouraged for the sake of user security.

### URL Parameters
- `userID: Int` - The Discord user ID whose GitHub token is stored.

### Status codes
- `200` - All information was valid and the database entry was successfully returned.
- `400` - Missing a certain piece of information. The returned error will describe what went wrong.
- `404` - The userID was not found in the database.

## POST `/github` <a name="post-github"></a>
Creates a new entry in the database relating a userID to their GitHub token. Again, you *can* technically store it as a plaintext string, but it's highly discouraged. Please POST with some type of encryption. What type of encryption is used is up to you.

### Body
- `userID: Int`: The Discord ID of the user
- `token: String`: the **encrypted** GitHub token for this user

### Status codes
- `200` - All information was valid and the database entry was successfully returned.
- `400` - Missing a certain piece of information. The returned error will describe what went wrong.

# Examples <a name="examples"></a>
Following are a few examples on how to use the different endpoints.
The actual IP of the API server or the domain should be substituted for `server-ip`.

Please also keep in mind the authentication has been left out these examples for the sake of brevity and that they are all identical. If you want to know how to authenticate correctly, please refer to the [Authentication](#auth) section

```
POST https://server-ip/file/

{
  "userID": "432643355634171905",
  "filename": "index.js",
  "url": "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844432226745057280/929190129397022750/index.js"
}
```

```
GET https://server-ip/file?fileID=579d92b9-0c2a-4337-a269-f6053cf545a6
```
Note that for most libraries that aid in making HTTP requests, there will
most likely be a way to pass in a JSON-like object for the querystring params
rather than having to format it manually.

```
DELETE https://server-ip/file?fileID=579d92b9-0c2a-4337-a269-f6053cf545a6
```

```
PATCH https://server-ip/file

{
  "fileID": "579d92b9-0c2a-4337-a269-f6053cf545a6",
  "filename": "new_index.js",
  "url": "https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/844432226745057280/929190129397022750/new_index.js"
}
